It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change"
"0b7e90ae-628c-480a-8d26-2b5307be9ebc: The biggest hit and second single from Kanye’s third studio album, Graduation, “Stronger” samples French electronic music duo Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,” which in turn samples Edwin Birdsong’s 1979 track, “Cola Bottle Baby.”"

That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, ""I love you too"""

Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters"

"42ba302a-c600-4d91-ae4e-d33958e16f24: The first track off Kanye West’s album 808s & Heartbreak. Sung primarily in autotune, and seen as a departure from old school Ye.

Kanye has explained in concert that this song is “about an ex-girlfriend you call on Friday nights just to have sex” and she “says she’ll come over but you wait all night and she still doesn’t come knocking on your door”

This song is highly criticised because of the prominent use of the auto-tune effect. This song (and album) was groundbreaking for Kanye West as an artist. As he demonstrated something totally different to what he usually did, people became worried that Kanye West pandered to the mainstream music audience in producing and writing this album.

On October 19th, 2015, Kanye released a remastered version, featuring violinist Caroline Shaw."
"1b3a340a-4d1f-4504-a397-89a986dd076c: Kanye’s intro to his third album, Graduation, is a wake-up call to himself and the world. It also gives Kanye a chance to show off his polished lyrical abilities.

The song is part of a larger metaphor: The album Graduation is Kanye’s “graduation” in the rap game. “Good Morning” is told as if Kanye is waking up on his Graduation Day, reminiscing about his college days and finally receiving his “rapping degree” in the third verse. The school/college theme is very present throughout the song.

Kanye samples Jay-Z’s “The Ruler’s Back” and Elton John’s “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” (both artists have been featured on one of Kanye’s songs).

On a side note, as if writing and producing this track wasn’t enough, Ye also developed a creative storyline for a video – despite the song never being released as an actual single.

The music video for “Good Morning” is essentially the result of Japanese pop artist Takashi Murakami bringing to life the various designs he had composed for Graduation’s album artwork through the use of cel-shaded animation."
"5eb1effb-24c3-4e11-a812-2eaac3cc33c1: In “Flashing Lights”, Kanye is found reminiscing about a flighty, capricious ex-girlfriend he can’t stop thinking about.

Similar to “Homecoming”, Kanye uses this girl as a metaphor for his public audience, to whose chaotic whims he’s forced to cater to.

There is also a video filmed during a studio session for Kanye’s 2010 magnum opus “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” with Ye and longtime collaborator Charlie Wilson when they jam to the Flashing Lights instrumental. They sang the song with a new hook that goes:

Hey everybody, tonight’s the night
I’ve been waiting my whole life
Who would have known what it was like?
Running from these flashing lights

The song was later given to K-Pop group JYJ for their song Ayy Girl, which also featured Malik Yusef."
