Kanye has explained in concert that this song is “about an ex-girlfriend you call on Friday nights just to have sex” and she “says she’ll come over but you wait all night and she still doesn’t come knocking on your door”

This song is highly criticised because of the prominent use of the auto-tune effect. This song (and album) was groundbreaking for Kanye West as an artist.

It also gives Kanye a chance to show off his polished lyrical abilities.

The song is part of a larger metaphor: The album Graduation is Kanye’s “graduation” in the rap game. “Good Morning” is told as if Kanye is waking up on his Graduation Day, reminiscing about his college days and finally receiving his “rapping degree” in the third verse. The school/college theme is very present throughout the song.

Kanye samples Jay-Z’s “The Ruler’s Back” and Elton John’s “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” (both artists have been featured on one of Kanye’s songs).

On a side note, as if writing and producing this track wasn’t enough, Ye also developed a creative storyline for a video – despite the song never being released as an actual single.
